- <h2>ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Emre UÄŸur,
I'm currently an undergraduate student at *Ihsan DoÄŸramacÄ± Bilkent University* in Ankara. 
I got first introduced to coding with **Scratch** which is a software intended to teach kids coding.
The idea of managing inputs and creating logic for a simple game was so fascinating that i tought myself
to code with [Solo Learn](https://www.sololearn.com/home). I'm currently confident with *Java*, *Python*, *C++* and *JavaScript* and familiar
with most of the programming languages. I am currently intrested in building fullstack web applications. [Poker Chips](https://github.com/Emruur/PokerChipsApp)
is the current project that i'm working on, it uses React.js as the frontend framework and Firebase services for database and authentication. Feel free to collaborate.
